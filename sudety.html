                    <h2>Karkonosze</h2>
                    A characteristic element of the Karkonosze landscape and the Karkonosze National Park (location on Google map) are picturesque rock formations, called little rocks – they have various, often fantastic shapes and are associated with legends. There are waterfalls on many streams, the most famous of which are: Kamieńczyka Waterfall and Szklarki Waterfall. The highest peak of the Sudetes (Śnieżka) is located in the Karkonosze Mountains. The main tourist destinations of this region are the towns of Jelenia Góra, Szklarska Poręba, Karpacz (Karpacz’s website in English covering attractions for families).

                    Some scenes from the movie “The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian” were shot in Poland, in the Karkonosze Mountains (in the Kamieńczyka Gorge).                </p>

                    <h2>Izerskie Mountains</h2>
                    Because of being not too high (with tops located at the height of 1000 – 1126 meters above the sea level), the Izerskie Mountains are very comfortable for hiking – almost any tourist can handle climbing them, even without detailed preparation. Additionally, there are many cycling routes prepared in the Izerskie Mountains, with different difficulty levels and lengths. Not far from Jakuszyce – a district of a vacation town of Szklarska Poreba – in the Jakuszycka Meadow, many routes for cross country skiing were created. In this place, you can also see the prestigious Piast Race. Another great attraction is the dog sled race, which lasts a few days                <p>

                <h2>Stołowe Mountains</h2>
                The Stołowe Mountains (the Table Mountains) and the Stołowe Mountains National Park (location on Google map) are worth visiting due to their unique topography. The mountain massif consists of plates that are arranged horizontally – mountains of this type in Europe are very rare. According to many, they are the most interesting mountains in Poland. The highest peak is Szczeliniec Wielki mountain (919 m above sea level), other attractions include rock labyrinths (the most famous one – Błędne Skały).            </p>

                    <h2>Rudawy Janowickie</h2>
                    The Rudawy Janowickie region is characterized by rolling hills, rugged sandstone formations, dense forests, and pristine meadows. The unique sandstone rock formations, with their intricate shapes and patterns, offer an ideal playground for rock climbers and hikers. One of the most famous landmarks in this area is Szczeliniec Wielki, a massive sandstone peak that provides breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.

                    In addition to its natural beauty, Rudawy Janowickie boasts a rich historical heritage. The area is dotted with charming villages and historical sites, including the charming town of Janowice Wielkie. Here, visitors can explore beautiful architecture, such as the Janowice Palace, which dates back to the 18th century.                </p>

                <h2>Śnieżnik Massif</h2>


                The south-eastern corner of the Kłodzko Valley is occupied by the enormous Śnieżnik Massif. It is the second largest mountain group in the Polish Sudetes. It stretches from the Międzyleska Pass in the south to the Biała Lądecka valley, which separates it from the Złote Mountains.

                It is separated from the Bialskie Mountains by the Morawka valley and the Płoszczyna Pass. It closes the Kłodzko Valley from the east. The climate is very harsh, the top parts of the mountains should be classified as high-mountain climate.
                
                The highest peak – Śnieżnik (1,425 m above sea level), from which six flattened mountain arms extend in all directions, is covered with snow for over half a year. Hence its name(śnieg means snow in Polish). Another significant hill is also Czarna Góra (1206 m) – steep, lofty, with a black cap of spruce forest and a wooden observation tower at the top. The entire massif, with the exception of the top, is covered with uniform forests, mostly spruce (19th-century plantings), although there are also beautiful mixed forests. The forests are cut by tens of kilometers of paved roads built in the middle of the Nineteenth century for the needs of industrial logging, and today for walks. In narrow, dark valleys lie the two most important towns of the Śnieżnik Massif – separated from the world, captivating Międzygórze, with a large tourist base, and the former mining town of Kletno with interesting former uranium mine.            </p>
