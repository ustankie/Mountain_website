            Mountains in Poland are, next to the Baltic Sea and lakes,  <br>
            one of the biggest attractions for tourists who value contact with nature.  <br>
            Mountains in Poland include 3 main mountain ranges: Sudetes (Sudety), Carpathians (Karpaty),  <br>
            and Świętokrzyskie Mountains (Góry Świętokrzyskie) and 28 smaller mountain ranges within them.   <br>
            The highest and the youngest are the Carpathians with the Tatra Mountains, and the oldest and  <br>
            lowest are the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. Those who like mountain hiking can choose among various trails in Poland, <br> 
            including trails suitable for families with children, seniors, and all those who love nature. <br>
            he Tatra Mountains (‘Tatry’ in Polish) – the <br>
            highest mountains in Poland, located in the south of <br>
            Poland and protected as national parkland – are part <br>
            of the Carpathian Mountains. The town of Zakopane <br>
            (location on Google map) is in the heart of the Polish 
            <br>Tatra Mountains, serving as a starting point for hiking <br>
            trails for amateurs as well as experienced hikers (275 km of marked hiking trails!). The highest peak in Polish <br>
            Tatras (Rysy) is 2,499 m but <br>
            the mountains are rich in trails suitable for families with children (including toddlers), <br>
            seniors, and all those who love nature.<br>
